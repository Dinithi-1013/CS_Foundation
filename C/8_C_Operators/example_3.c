/*
 * This file demonstrates the use of logical "and" (&&) and "or" (||) operators in C.
 *
 * The "and" operator (&&) evaluates to true if both operands are true.
 * The "or" operator (||) evaluates to true if at least one of the operands is true.
 *
 * These operators are commonly used in conditional statements to combine multiple conditions.
