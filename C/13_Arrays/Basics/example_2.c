// so here is the deal you can make arrays into many dimensions even 100s or 2000s
// what matters is the efficiency and readablity of the code and also you have to ask the question why
// think of 1 dimenstion like the x axis
// then 2 dimensions as having x and y axises
// we learned in als about the z axis right that is simply the 3 dimension
void somemore(void)
{
    // we can use the matrix we learned in als here also to do calculation figure that out tho
    // i mean i wil explain it in the class hee hee
