# Question

Write a C program that can both encrypt and decrypt messages using a simple cipher. The program should:

1. Ask the user to choose between encryption and decryption.
2. For encryption:
    - Ask the user to enter a message.
    - Generate a random numeric code (key) for encryption.
    - Encrypt the message using the code and display both the encrypted message and the code.
3. For decryption:
    - Ask the user to enter the encrypted message and the code.
    - Decrypt the message using the code and display the original message.

Use a simple Caesar cipher (shifting each character by the code value) for encryption and decryption.

This project should be done again when you have learned 2D arrays.
Then it should simply have the cipher done using matrices.
